* This change is to enable the class to use scanner to scan each line for easier search for particular string.

## Adding new list of elements

* This change is to have easier process to check the number of symbols in the line to determine whether there is a link in it.

## Revised method
![screenshot3](https://github.com/Jerrik0/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/Lab2screen3.png?raw=true)
* This method first checks whether the line contains a image or not, then it checks if tere is a link within it by looking for 4 symbols in the list created.
* Then it checks all the symbols for the correct link.
